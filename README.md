## Code Quiz
# Challenge #4 - Week 4:


# Project Description
### What is this project?
This weeks project is a coding quiz. My goal is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in unison, and present a coding quiz that is timed, keeps track of score and runs through multiple choice questions. There will be right and wrong answers, and if the user selects the wrong answer, they will be penalised ten seconds for each wrong answer.

### Files modified
This project is done from scratch, so I will managing through three main files. Including index.html, style.css and script.js.

### Challenges
My understanding of the task was initially positive. I understood what was asked of me, and tackled it reasonably well at first. However, a challenge that I faced throughout the week, can relate to how I dedicated far too much time on developing an appropriate method to switch between the questions. Due to the classes having the same name in the HTML file, it couldn't specifically identity the button when clicked. I experimented with for loops and arrays to counter this issue. However, after several attempts, I couldn't develop an effective solution to my predicament. Due time constraints I eventually turned to changing each right/wrong class to have a unique ID.
