# Project Description
### What is this project?
This weeks project is a coding quiz. My goal is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in unison to present a coding quiz that is timed, keeps track of score and runs through ten multiple choice questions. Additioanlly if the user selects the wrong answer, they will be penalised minus ten seconds for each wrong answer.

### Files modified
As mentioned above, I will be managing through three main files. Including index.html, style.css and script.js.
